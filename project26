By parboiling the rice, the Biryani can be steamed instead of boiled. This renders the chicken tender and juicy.
Marinating the chicken and then browning it ensures it is seasoned to the core while creating new layers of flavor thanks to Maillard browning.
Properly caramelizing the onions adds loads of umami, and it also lends a subtle sweetness that‚Äôs the perfect contrast to the savory and spicy chicken.

What is Chicken Biryani?
Although widely associated with Indian cuisine, Chicken Biryani is a dish that has spread across a wide swath of South Asia, reaching as far west as Iraq and as far east as Indonesia. The vast geographical area Biryani calls home has resulted in a wide variety of preparations and ingredients; however, it is typically prepared by layering seasoned chicken with rice and aromatics and steaming them together.

What does Biryani mean?
The name Biryani is thought to be derived from the Persian word birinj (ÿ®ÿ±ŸÜÿ¨‚Äé) which means ‚Äúrice‚Äù.

What do you eat with Chicken Biryani?
I like to serve my Chicken Biryani with cooling raita made with yogurt, mint, cilantro, and a pinch of salt, but this is also good with a variety of different chutneys. I know it‚Äôs a lot of carbs, but I also love serving biryani with a basket of fresh pillowy naan, my friend Bee over at Rasa Malaysia has a fantastic Fail-Proof Naan recipe that I‚Äôm a fan of.

What‚Äôs the difference between Biryani and Pulao
Pulao (a.k.a. Pilaf), is also a rice dish that can be found in similar regions of the world as Biryani. While there‚Äôs some debate as to the difference between Biryani and Pulao, the latter tends to have less meat and veggies relative to the rice, which means it‚Äôs usually served as a side rather than an entree. The second big difference is that Biryani is generally layered and steamed, which creates a wonderful variation in flavor, texture, and color when mixed together.

STEPS
To marinate the chicken for the biryani, combine the vegetable oil, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, mint, cilantro, garam masala, cinnamon and salt in a large bowl and stir together. Add the chicken pieces and toss together making sure the chicken is thoroughly coated in the marinade. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.
In a pot wide enough to hold the chicken in a single layer, add the ghee and onions and saute the onions until they are well caramelized (15-20 minutes). Transfer the caramelized onions to a bowl and set aside.
Caramelized onions add a pleasant sweetness to contrast the spicy chicken in the Biryani.

While the onions caramelize, prepare the rice by washing in a strainer under cold running water until the water runs clear.
It's important to wash your rice thouroughly to rid it of any excess starch so your Biryani turns out fluffy.
To par-boil the rice, add the water, salt, cardamom, cumin and bay leaf to a pot and bring to a boil. Add the rice and boil for 7 minutes. Drain the rice, reserving 1 cup of the liquid.
Parboiling the rice with spices not only ensures the rice is cooked through, it infuses your biryani with tons of flavor.

In the pot you caramelized the onions in, add the chicken in a single layer, skin-side down. Fry until golden brown on one side (about 5 minutes). Flip the chicken over and fry the other side until golden brown. Transfer the chicken back to the bowl you marinated it in.
Browning the chicken for the Biryani brings out the flavors of the spices and aromatics in the marinade.
To assemble the biryani, add the saffron to the rice and toss to distribute evenly. Add half the rice mixture to the bottom of the pot you browned the chicken in.
Top the rice with the chicken in a single layer.
The browned chicken gets layeed on the rice.
Top the chicken with an even layer of caramelized onions.
A layer of caramelized onions goes on top of the chicken for the Biryani.
Finish putting together the Biryani by adding the rest of the rice in an even layer. Add 1 cup of reserved liquid from boiling the rice. Cover the pot with a lid and put the pot on the stove over medium heat and set the timer for 20 minutes. When you can see steam escaping from under the lid, turn down the heat to low and continue cooking until the timer goes off and then turn off the heat.

The Biryani is finished off with a layer of saffron rice.
Without opening the lid, set the timer for another 10 minutes to steam the biryani.

Mix the Chicken Biryani together and then transfer to a serving platter. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve.

Don‚Äôt transfer cooked chicken back to the bowl you marinated the chicken in like he says in Step 5 without cleaning the bowl first. That‚Äôll get you sick.

Is it possible to use ground cardamom instead of whole, smashed cardamom for par-boiling the rice? Can jasmine rice be substituted? Thanks!

I don‚Äôt love the taste of saffron but the color is so lovely. Would it be okay if not totally authentic to use turmeric in its place to color and flavor the rice??

Thanks for sharing an informative post about chicken biryani. I had tasted some awesome Indian foods at Kulcha King last night and I never though that Indian foods like biryani, kulcha and kebab can taste that good. We even paid less because they offered us some discounts.
